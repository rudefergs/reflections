was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can control the information you save and it is alaos available offline. The commits function also allows you to comment about the change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because GIT was intended for coders as you usually need to make changes to several documents at the same time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all the commits that have been saved
    git diff shows the difference between the 2 files - red for deleted text and green for added text

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can troubleshoot easier and find the error that was made and just fix it without having to inspect line for line
